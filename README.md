# faceMash
A simple faceMash app is build using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Introduction
This is a project that allows users to compare teachers at their school and determine who is the best according to their classmates. It was inspired by the infamous faceMash that Mark Zuckerberg created in his college days, but with a twist. Instead of comparing people based on their looks, the project compares teachers using the chess Elo algorithm and a Swiss tournament system.
